<h1> About Excelsior </h1>
</center>
<p> Excelsior program is a house in Newburgh Free Academy. In this house they prepare you for college courses as soon as possible. You can
  graduate with your high school diploma and a applied associated degree in computer science within 4 to 6 year depending on how hard you work. In the Newburgh Excelsior we are partnered with
   IBM. When we graduate we have a guaranteed interview, not a guaranteed job. When you join Excelsior you are given a mentor. This mentor
   will be with you throughout your entire time in Excelsior. You may get a different mentor if your mentor either quits, gets fired, or moves.
  In your third year you are able to get a paid internship. Depending on how you work on your internship they may hire you after you
graduate. </p>
